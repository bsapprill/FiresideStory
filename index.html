      <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
      <p>a man sat uncreatively in his room in front of a computer monitor</p>
      <p>Then lightning struck his pretty graphics machine... Sad life!</p>
      <p>He sat in stunned disbelief, unable to process what had happened.</p>
      <p>...HEH! That processor pun!</p>
